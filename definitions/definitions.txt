Life: 
1. A timed multiple choice exam - which most people end up failing.  
2. A sexually-transmitted, terminal disease. 
3. The meaningless void between birth and death. 
4. What you need according to the internet. 
5. The most unfair thing about life is the way it ends. I mean, life is tough. It takes up a lot of your time. What do you get at the end of it? A death! What's that, a bonus?!? I think the life cycle is all backwards. You should die first, get it out of the way. The you go live in an old age home. You get kicked out for being too healthy, go collect your pension, then, when you start work, you get a gold watch on your first day.  You work forty years until you're young enough to enjoy your retirement. You drink alcohol, you party, and you get ready for High School. You go to primary school, you become a kid, you play, you have no responsibilities, you become a little boy(girl), you go back, you spend your last 9 months floating with luxuries like central heating, spa, room service on tap, then you finish off as an orgasm!!

7. Life's a test..... do you pass? 
8. The most fatal disease of all-time. Life has killed more people than all the other diseases combined. Life still kills tens of thousands of people everyday, and even more plants, animals, and insects. Side effects often include more diseases, suicide wounds, pain, sleep deprivation, stress, eating disorders and mental disorders. Your diagnosis of Life is shown on your birth certificate; see birth certificate. Also see birthday. 
9. A phenomenon I found myself in one day.  By no other means shall I try to explain it. 
10. A terminal disease contracted during birth and has a 100% mortality rate.
